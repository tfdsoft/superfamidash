## About

A demake of Geometry Dash for the SNES.

This is a **work-in-progress** port of [Famidash](https://github.com/TFDSoft/Famidash).

## Compiling

To compile, you will need to build [iProgramInCpp's fork of CC65](https://github.com/iProgramMC/cc65).
Standard CC65 won't work.

Note that this fork can act as a stand-in for the CC65 suite, so you don't need to worry about managing
separate CC65 instances.
